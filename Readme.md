TO-DO LIST (when 'X' is pressed)
- Add event handler

EVENT BUBBLING
- When an event is triggered (fired) on some DOM element, then the exact same element is triggered
on all the parent elements 
- Event BUBBLES up in the DOM tree

TARGET ELEMENT
- ie. <button>Link</button>

EVENT DELAGATION
- Attach the event handler to the parent from the child element

2. When we want an event handler attached to an element that is not yet in the DOM when our page is loaded
